## Getting User Input, Conditionals, and Scope
Animal guessing game. When the page is loaded the user is prompted to guess an animal. Once they submit their answer the program will either tell them that they correctly guessed the animal or that they should try again.

### Topics Covered
* The prompt function and user input
* Creating a variable
* Conditional statement
* Functions
* Scope

### Step 1
Create a variable that takes in user input via the prompt function that asks "Of what animal am I thinking?". Write a conditional statement (if/else) that alerts "How did you know?!" if the user guesses "turtle" and alerts "Try again." if the user did not guess "turtle" correctly.

### Step 2
Refactor your code above into a function called `animalGuess`, using the scaffolding code provided. Think about the variable `animalName` and how it is different than `animal`. Answer the question: What will `console.log(animalName)` log outside the `animalGuess` function?

### Files Provided
* index.html - Sources the JavaScript file (`script.js`). There isn't much happening here and you are not required to make changes to this file.
* script.js - This is where you will add your code. We have provided some scaffolding code and comments to help you get started.

## Objects and Prototypes
Here we'll take a look at using a prototype class and explore creating a new object from this class. Also, we'll delve into the basics of Object Oriented Programming by using properties and methods of an object derived from a prototype.

### Topics Covered
* Creating a new object from a prototype class
* Accessing data within an object
* Adding a method to an object
* Calling an object's method

You can refer to the Codecademy lesson JavaScript 8 (Objects II) for reference if needed.

### Step 1
create a new animal named "somethingFun" with a first name of "Something" a last name of "Fun" and a type of "Cat"

### Step 2
console log out somethingFun's first and last name

### Step 3 (Hard Mode)
add a method to somethingFun named "meow()" that console logs "moew" when called. ex: somethingFun.meow()

### Step 4 (Pro Mode)
add another method to somethingFun named that receives a boolean: "isHappy( happy )"

within this method, check if the parameter "happy" is true

if so, console log "purrrrrr"

if not, console log "crabby face"


### Files Provided
* index.html - Sources the JavaScript file (`prototypes.js`). There isn't much happening here and you are not required to make changes to this file.
* prototypes.js - This is where you will add your code. We have provided some scaffolding code and comments to help you get started.
